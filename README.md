# ToDo_appFlutter
The ToDo app is a simple and efficient task management application. Upon launching the app, users are presented with a clean interface that displays their list of tasks. Each task item includes relevant information such as the task name, due date, and priority level. Users can perform the following actions:

Adding New Tasks: Users can easily add new tasks by tapping a button or using a dedicated input field. They provide a task name, set a due date (if applicable), and choose a priority level (e.g., high, medium, low).
Updating Existing Tasks: To modify an existing task, users can select it from the list. This opens an edit screen where they can adjust the task name, due date, or priority. After making changes, they save the updated task.
Deleting Tasks: If a task is no longer relevant, users can delete it by swiping left or using a delete button. The app confirms the deletion to prevent accidental removal.
Task Prioritization: The app automatically sorts tasks based on their priority level. High-priority tasks appear at the top of the list, ensuring users focus on urgent items first.
User-Friendly Interface: The app’s design emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. Clear icons, intuitive gestures, and smooth animations enhance the overall user experience.
Whether it’s managing work assignments, personal goals, or grocery lists, the ToDo app streamlines task organization and helps users stay productive
